/**
 * Proof that an UNLOCK released the lock, from a session that did not hold it.
 *
 * **An UNLOCK that answers 200 has not necessarily released anything.** Since
 * `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` 9.3.1 a stateless request goes without
 * `sap-contextid`, so an UNLOCK sent stateless runs in a fresh ABAP context,
 * answers 200 and leaves the enqueue entry where it was. Three handlers did
 * exactly that — include, service binding, message class — and the suites
 * passed, because all they asked of the UNLOCK was its status. What gave it
 * away, on-prem, was the next step: activation answered 403 EU/510 "currently
 * editing". On cloud there is no SM12 to look at.
 *
 * The observable proof is the one a colleague would get: LOCK the same object
 * from a DIFFERENT ABAP session. A lock still held is refused — 403, "currently
 * editing" / "is locked by" — and a released one is granted, and is then
 * released again here. The test's own session cannot answer the question: the
 * session holding a lock is granted it again.
 *
 * It costs one session logon per check, so `VERIFY_LOCK_RELEASED=false` turns
 * it off. The trial grants two sessions — the run's and this one — so the
 * session is always closed before this returns, and never two are open at once.
